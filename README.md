Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc., were capable of manifesting&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Electrostatic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic">electrostatic</a>&nbsp;properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impairs the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Electrical insulation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_insulation">electrical insulation</a>&nbsp;of such bodies.

This hypothesis could explain such features as light's ability to travel in straight lines and reflect off surfaces. However, this proposed theory was known to have its problems: although it explained reflection well, its explanation of refraction and diffraction was less satisfactory. In order to explain refraction, Newton postulated an "Aethereal Medium" transmitting vibrations faster than light, by which light, when overtaken, is put into "Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission", which he supposed caused the phenomena of&nbsp;<a title="Refraction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction">refraction</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Diffraction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction">diffraction</a>.</td>

The same work contained the celebrated formula known as Taylor's theorem, the importance of which remained unrecognized until 1772, when J. L.
